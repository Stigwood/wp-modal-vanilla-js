# wp-modal-vanilla-js
Vanilla JS that adds an automatic lightbox to wordpress images in posts

This is designed to seek out any images produced under the class 'wp-caption' and add a simple modal/lightbox function 
to open the image in a larger size.  It finds original image when you select 'media' when adding the image in your post.
